## Problem
In this fast growing world, we still stand in a queue for hours to apply for voter-id card. Also it take hours for us to cast our vote. Even sometimes, hooligans creates problem at polling booth and also tampers the EVM.<br><br>
The biggest problem facing by our Election Commission in today’s scenario is that some people cast vote by impersonating some other person, either dead or not present at the polling booth.
## Our Solution
We aim to build a web-app that would completely automate the process of voting in today’s world.
